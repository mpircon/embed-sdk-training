## Section 1: Embed SDK Set-up

### Introduction

The Looker JavaScript Embed SDK is designed to facilitate using Looker embedded content in your web application. The goal is to make communication between a host website and one or more embedded dashboards, looks or explores easier and more reliable.

> ### Topics Covered:
> * Demo Requirements & Set-up
> * Troubleshooting

### Demo

Download/clone the [**Looker Embed SDK Repository**](https://github.com/looker-open-source/embed-sdk) which includes sample code and a simple demo of the embed SDK. Because of Lookerâ€™s attention to security, the demo requires a bit of setup. The demo also requires your Looker embed secret. The embed secret grants access to all of your data, so note the following:

* Do not share your secret with anyone you do not want to have complete access to your instance.
* Do not reset your secret if you already are using it in another context.
* Your code should never store the secret in the web browser.

### Step 1: Enable Embedding in your Looker instance

(This is documented in more detail [here](https://docs.looker.com/r/sdk/sso-embed))

* Navigate to **Admin** > **Platform** > **Embed** on your Looker instance. This requires Admin privileges.
* The demo server runs by default at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). By adding that address to "Embedded Domain Whitelist" you can enabled the demo to receive messages from Looker.
* Turn on "Embed Authentication"
* In order to view your "Embed Secret" you must reset it. Copy the secret to someplace secure.

### Step 2: Customize the Demo settings for your Looker instance

1. Provide your embed secret to the server. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the sdk directory. Add the following to your file:
    ```javascript
      LOOKER_HOST_URL=https://customer.looker.com
      LOOKERSDK_BASE_URL=https://customer.looker.com:19999
      LOOKER_EMBED_SECRET=
      LOOKERSDK_CLIENT_ID=
      LOOKERSDK_CLIENT_SECRET=
    ```
  * Note: Update with your Host URL and add Embed Secret. Keep Client ID and Secret blank for now. We'll come back to this later.

2. Edit the `demo/demo_config.ts` file with the appropriate host and for the pages you want to embed.

    ```javascript
    // The address of your Looker instance. Required.
    export const lookerHost = 'customer.looker.com'

    // A dashboard that the user can see. Set to 0 to disable dashboard.
    export const dashboardId = 1
    // A Look that the user can see. Set to 0 to disable look.
    export const lookId = 1
    ```

3. Edit the `demo/demo_user.json` file to be appropriate for the type of user you want to embed.

    ```javascript
    {
      // External embed user ID. IDs are not shared with regular users. Required
      "external_user_id": "user1",
      // First and last name. Optional
      "first_name": "Pat",
      "last_name": "Embed",
      // Duration before session expires, in seconds. Required.
      "session_length": 3600,
      // Enforce logging in with these permissions. Recommended.
      "force_logout_login": true,
      // External embed group ID. Optional.
      "external_group_id": "group1",
      // Looker Group IDs. Optional
      "group_ids": [],
      // Permissions. See documentation for details. Required.
      "permissions": [
        "access_data",
        "see_looks",
        "see_user_dashboards",
      //   see_lookml_dashboards
        "explore",
      //   create_table_calculations
      //   download_with_limit
      //   download_without_limit
      //   see_drill_overlay
      //   see_sql
        "save_content",
        "embed_browse_spaces"
      //   schedule_look_emails
      //   send_to_sftp
      //   send_to_s3
      //   send_outgoing_webhook
      //   schedule_external_look_emails
      ],
      // Model access permissions. Required.
      "models": ["powered_by", "thelook"],
      // User attributes. Optional.
      "user_attributes": { "locale": "en_US" },
      // Access filters. Optional.
      "access_filters": { "powered_by": { "products.brand": "Allegra K" } }
    }
    ```

### Step 3: Build and run the demo

#### Node server

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* The server will print out what host and port it is running on. If it is different than `http://localhost:8080` then you will need to add that to your Embedded Domain Whitelist.

#### Python server

* `npm install`
* `npm run python`
* The server will print out what host and port it is running on.

You may need to `pip install six` to install the Python 2/3 compatibility layer.

### Troubleshooting

#### Logging

The Embed SDK is built on top of [chatty](https://github.com/looker-open-source/chatty). Chatty uses [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) for logging. You can enable logging
in a browser console with

```javascript
localStorage.debug = 'looker:chatty:*'
```

Note that both the parent window and the embedded content have separate local storage, so you can enable logging on one, the other or both. You can disable logging with

```javascript
localStorage.debug = ''
```
